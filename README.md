## Faulty Robot
Faulty Robot is a game I initially created for the GMTK 2023 Game Jam. The game jam took 2 days, and my original version can be found here: https://aloneinentropy.itch.io/faulty-robot
However, the reviews of the game said that the controls were difficult to use due to the camera being locked onto the character's position at all times.
I decided to work on the game afterwards by adding better camera controls and cursor indicators. 

The comments also said that the game's general idea was "unique", so I created more levels to run with the idea as much as possible. I added 7 more levels and a proper tutorial, background music, and a pause menu in the 2 weeks following the game jam's submission date. All assets were created by me during and after the game's submission.

The idea for Faulty Robot can be carried very far given the nigh-infinite potential for level design when given ample time and care, but this is something to be revisited in the future when I have the time. For now, Faulty Robot remains a simple continuation of a smaller project.

Faulty Robot was made in Godot 3.5.1 using GDScript.

## Shot in the Dark
Shot in the Dark is a continuation of my submission for the Brackeys 2022.2 game jam. This was my first time doing game development in Godot, and I had to learn how to use the software while trying to create a game in it in a period of 7 days. 

The end result was massively different from my initial idea, largely due to me overestimating my ability to improvise using unfamiliar technology. However, I was still able to adapt to the situation, modifying older scripts and drawing new assets to compensate. 

In the end, while the game is clearly underdeveloped, it was the first game jam I had ever entered, and the first game I could consider "finished". I did a bit of work on it after the submission but my skill level still wasn't enough to get the game where I had orignially envisioned, so I abandoned the project.

Shot in the Dark was made in Gdoot 3.5.1 using GDScript.

## Dead Overlap
Dead Overlap is also the continuation of a game jam, this time the Brackeys 2023.2 game jam. Due to a large scope, using new and still-in-development classes, and other personal circumstances, I was unable to submit what I had developed for the game jam, even with its 7 day sumbission deadline. 

However, now that I no longer have a deadline to rush towards, I can take as much time as I like to add new gameplay features, add more character interactions, and continue to develop the dialogue system I made for RPGs.

Dead Overlap is in development using Godot 4 and C#.
