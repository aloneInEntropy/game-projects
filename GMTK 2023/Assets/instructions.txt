Welcome to Faulty Robot! The goal of this game is to help this poor, delusional little robot reach its goal and save the princess!

Unfortunately, the robot was created by a computer science student and, as a result, has some pretty poor AI. Your goal is to aid the robot by becoming God. :)

Your goal as God is to alter the dungeon the robot is in to allow it to pass through certain obstacles and reach its goals. There are multiple goals (princesses I swear) and the robot must reach them all.

However, because God isn't real, you have a limited ability. You have a limited number of tiles to place and destroy, and this amount only refils every so often. Additionally, tiles you place and break will break and be replaced after a period of time, so you won't be able to sit back and relax while your devoted servant is busy doing all the work :(

You can LEFT CLICK to place this tiles and RIGHT CLICK to destroy tiles, but NOT your own placed tiles.

The robot will be dropped into a random location within the dungeon. You have a set amount of time between reaching goals. Reach every goal before your time runs out! (You wouldn't want to break its heart...)
