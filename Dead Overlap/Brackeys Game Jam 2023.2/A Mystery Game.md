| September 7th  | Makoto's wife, ***Adora Aga***, had left on a "business trip". Adora is not believed to have been employed at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ??:??          | Makoto receives a cut-out letter with the text, "WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. LEAVE €10,000 ON THE STEPS OF THE MAYOR'S BUILDING BY SEPTEMBER 10TH OR WE WILL LEAK THE FOOTAGE."                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:04          | Makoto was seen entering the office of the mayor, ***Patrick Cuno***, carrying a folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 13:11          | Makoto leaves the office without the folder and returns home, buying a bandage and newspaper from the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:54          | The police are called, but the line hangs up just seconds later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   
| 17:22          | Makoto is caught speeding on the road. When questioned by the police officer, ***Johnny Lain***, he is noted as being "cordial". He accepts the ticket and leaves.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17:27          | Makoto is caught speeding on the road again. When questioned by the second police officer, ***Ignacio Pascal***, he is noted as being "frantic, in a hurry, and anxious". He screams and curses the police officer, but ultimately accepts the second ticket and leaves.                                              |
| 18:48          | Makoto returns to the market and buys several cans of food, knives, sheets of paper, newspapers, syringes, and three more bandages. He was overheard having an argument with the cashier, identified as ***Marie Bornstein***. This was the same cashier he bought the bandage and newspaper from.                     |
| 21:24          | Makoto is found dead on his couch with a bloody knife in his hand. And his house is trashed. The DNA tests show that the blood is inhuman. His death was ruled to be a heart attack. He was not bleeding and had no history of heart problems. There are several holes (potentially injection sites) on his arms. |     
| September 9th  | ***Jordan Cuno***, the mayor's child, and ***Farah Sal-Cuno***, Jordan's wife, visit a hospital several states over after getting in a car crash and stayed there for three days.                                                                                                                                      |
| September 11th | Adora returns from her "business trip".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   

Afterwards, a bag of heroin was found in his car, but there was none in his system. When questioned, Adora claimed Makoto to be "rash at times, and a savage". When asked about a drug problem, she admitted she also believed the rumour, but had no proof on whether or not it was true. She did not appear to be distraught over the death of her husband.

Jordan and Farah have wounds on their stomach and arms that they claim is from broken glass from Jordan's car after the crash. The bloody glass matched both of their DNA.

Johnny notably did not submit any information to the Garda about the ticket, allowing it to go unpunished. His speed camera, when checked, caught the exchange. He was also seen poking Makoto with something, though what exactly it was is unknown. Ignacio, on the other hand, miswrote the Makoto's last name (an honest mistake) and wrote in his notes section, "possible drug usage? heroin?". He wrote up the ticket.

Patrick Cuno refused to speak on the file he was given by Makoto. Shouting was heard from Cuno's office during Makoto's visit.

Marie was questioned on the argument she had with Makoto as it wasn't fully heard by passer-by's, but she declined to comment. The phrase "poked today" is reported to have been heard during the argument.

## Actual Events
Makoto's fame and likeability turned out to be a curse for him. Although he was only a surgeon, he was treated like a rockstar. This resulted in him gaining enemies for a variety of reasons. However, although four separate parties attempted to kill him, none of them managed it. In reality, Makoto was feeling mounting stress from his workload, making a severe mistake that resulted in the death of a relative of a powerful figure. This, combined with his wife leaving the day prior, the ransom note, him getting poked repeatedly throughout the day, and an actual attack in the evening, resulted in Makoto suffering a severe heart attack and dying.

### Groups
#### Patrick Cuno and Marie Bornstein
Patrick was jealous of Makoto's fame and the fact that Makoto, without any experience in the field of politics, nearly toppled his mayorship and likely could if he tried. Marie, on the other hand, simply disliked Makoto's laidback attitude towards life and his success. She was jealous of his finances, herself failing medical school four times, and wanted him to pay for his carelessness. The two met at [Jordan's](app://obsidian.md/index.html#Jordan%20Cuno) 24th birthday party and conspired to kill him.

They planned to use Patrick's well-known dislike of Makoto to slander him, forcing Makoto to give Patrick several of his personal banking details and police records on several occasions. On September 8th, while there, Patrick "accidentally" stabbed Makoto in the hand with a pen tipped with potent poison that would kill him in a matter of hours. If the poison didn't work, Marie would do the exact same thing when he visited the market. She made sure she was the only one working that day.

On both occasions, the poison leaked into the pen tip soon after application and did not affect Makoto, though the tip itself did draw blood.

#### Johnny Lain and Ignacio Pascal
Johnny too envied Makoto's finances and wanted to frame him. After falling into poverty, he grew embarrassed and pitiful for having to ask Makoto for financial aid, even as a police officer. He wanted to frame Makoto for being a drug abuser, arrest him, then let him go, just to feel power over him again. He had never planned to kill him, but went about it in an extremely dangerous way. Ignacio's feelings were far stronger than Johnny's, as Makoto failed to save his son after a stroke. He hated Makoto for this, as he was supposed to be the "master neurosurgeon". 

Ignacio teamed up with Johnny (after careful consideration) and planned for Johnny to inject Makoto with heroin after stopping him for speeding. Afterwards, Ignacio would stop him again and inject him again. He antagonised Makoto, forcing him to erupt in rage and exit his car, mad about getting poked so often and about how he knew he wasn't speeding. Ignacio made sure the dosage of heroin in his syringe was lethal, and threw a small bag of heroin powder in the back of his car for good measure.

Ignacio entrusted Johnny with retrieving the syringes of heroin, as he didn't want to implicate himself if he got caught. Johnny managed to get three syringes of saline to swap out for heroin, but forgot which of the three syringes he put heroin into after filling the first syringe. When filling the second syringe with heroin, he accidentally poured out the first syringe again. After losing one in the changing room, he rushed to get the other two to Ignacio, ignoring the potential lacklustre potency as he didn't actually want to kill Makoto, only ruin his life. The syringes Makoto was injected with contained saline.

#### Adora Ada
Adora had long since fallen out of love for her husband. After he made it clear he didn't want to have any children with Adora, she began making plans to leave him. She then theorised that it was unlikely she would get any of his fortune if she initiated the divorce herself, as Makoto would have no reason to want to divorce her and might have simply kept his wealth to himself. However, he have a will written. The will dictated that Adora would inherit the entire estate after his death. 

Adora crafted an improvised explosive utilising knowledge of her chemistry classes, as well as looking up past examples in the library. She set it off behind the house on September 7th then left for a few days, claiming it to be a "business trip". She made a second bomb and placed it in front of the house.

Neither bomb went off. She set both incorrectly, and the second bomb (in front of the house) exploded the day after she returned, breaking a window and burning some grass. Because it was raining, no fires were started.

#### Jordan Cuno and Farah Sal-Cuno
Jordan and Farah were always an odd pair. 

## Outside Events
### Death of Simon O'Hare
After Cuno and Bornstein's murder attempt, they threw away both pens, believing them to no longer contain the poison but wanting to destroy any evidence regardless. A 12-year-old boy, Simon, liked to collect pens he saw outside and drink their ink. Since both pens had their poison drain down into the ink, Simon ended up getting poisoned by the ink. He complained to his parents about stomach pains, but they assumed it was the food they ate that afternoon. Later in the day, Simon went out again and found the other pen and drank the ink from it. He then proceeded to die.

The poison was detected in Simon's blood and was checked for in Makoto's, but it was not found. 

### Heroin syringe
A syringe of heroin was found in a men's changing room. In spite of the numerous pricks found in Makoto's skin, most likely from a syringe, there was no trace of heroin found in his system.

### Improvised explosive
An improvised explosive was found behind Makoto's house. 

### Missing dog
The German Shepard of Farah's cousin, Juno, had gone missing a on September 5th. He has not been found since.
