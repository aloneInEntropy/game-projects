| Date           | Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **September 7th**  | Makoto's wife, ***Adora Aga***, had left on a "business trip". Adora is not believed to have been employed at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **September 8th** ??:??          | Makoto receives a [[#Cut-out letter\|ransom letter]].                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:04          | Makoto was seen entering the office of the mayor, ***Patrick Cuno***, carrying a folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:11          | Makoto leaves the office without the folder and returns home, buying a bandage and newspaper from the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:54          | The police are called, but the line hangs up just seconds later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:22          | Makoto is caught speeding on the road. When questioned by the police officer, ***Johnny Lawn***, he is noted as being "cordial". He accepts the ticket and leaves.                                                                                                                                                |
| 17:27          | Makoto is caught speeding on the road again. When questioned by the second police officer, ***Ignacio Pascal***, he is noted as being "frantic, in a hurry, and anxious". He screams and curses the police officer, but ultimately accepts the second ticket and leaves.                                          |
| 18:48          | Makoto returns to the market and buys several cans of food, knives, sheets of paper, newspapers, syringes, and three more bandages. He was overheard having an argument with the cashier, identified as ***Marie Bornstein***. This was the same cashier he bought the bandage and newspaper from.                |
| 21:24          | Makoto is found dead on his couch with a bloody knife in his hand. And his house is trashed. The DNA tests show that the blood is inhuman. His death was ruled to be a heart attack. He was not bleeding and had no history of heart problems. There are several holes (potentially injection sites) on his arms. |
| **September 9th**  | ***Jordan Cuno***, the mayor's child, and ***Farah Sal-Cuno***, Jordan's wife, visit a hospital several states over after getting in a car crash and stayed there for three days.                                                                                                                                 |
| **September 10th** | *Simon O'Hare* passes away in the hospital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **September 11th** | Adora returns from her "business trip".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **September 12th** | ***Marceline Ren*** arrives in Shune.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Afterwards, a bag of heroin was found in his car, but there was none in his system. When questioned, Adora claimed Makoto to be "rash at times, and a savage". When asked about a drug problem, she admitted she also believed the rumour, but had no proof on whether or not it was true. She did not appear to be distraught over the death of her husband. An explosive was also detonated near her house, causing minor damage, but this was not reported by her.

Jordan and Farah have wounds on their stomach and arms that they claim is from broken glass from Jordan's car after the crash. The bloody glass matched both of their DNA.

Johnny notably did not submit any information to the Garda about the ticket, allowing it to go unpunished. His speed camera, when checked, caught the exchange. He was also seen poking Makoto with something, though what exactly it was is unknown. Ignacio, on the other hand, miswrote the Makoto's last name (an honest mistake) and wrote in his notes section, "possible drug usage? heroin?". He wrote up the ticket.

Patrick Cuno refused to speak on the file he was given by Makoto. Shouting was heard from Cuno's office during Makoto's visit.

Marie was questioned on the argument she had with Makoto as it wasn't fully heard by passer-by's, but she declined to comment. The phrase "poked today" is reported to have been heard during the argument.

## Actual Events
Makoto's fame and likeability turned out to be a curse for him. Although he was only a surgeon, he was treated like a rockstar. This resulted in him gaining enemies for a variety of reasons. However, although four separate parties attempted to kill him, none of them managed it. In reality, Makoto was feeling mounting stress from his workload, making a severe mistake that resulted in the death of a relative of a powerful figure. This, combined with his wife leaving the day prior, the ransom note, him getting poked repeatedly throughout the day, and an actual attack in the evening, resulted in Makoto suffering a severe heart attack and dying.

### Groups
#### Patrick Cuno and Marie Bornstein
Patrick was jealous of Makoto's fame and the fact that Makoto, without any experience in the field of politics, nearly toppled his mayorship and likely could if he tried. Marie, on the other hand, simply disliked Makoto's laidback attitude towards life and his success. She was jealous of his finances, herself failing medical school four times, and wanted him to pay for his carelessness. The two met at [Jordan's](app://obsidian.md/index.html#Jordan%20Cuno) 24th birthday party and conspired to kill him.

They planned to use Patrick's well-known dislike of Makoto to slander him, forcing Makoto to give Patrick several of his personal banking details and police records on several occasions. On September 8th, while there, Patrick "accidentally" stabbed Makoto in the hand with a pen tipped with potent poison that would kill him in a matter of hours. If the poison didn't work, Marie would do the exact same thing when he visited the market. She made sure she was the only one working that day.

On both occasions, the poison leaked into the pen tip soon after application and did not affect Makoto, though the tip itself did draw blood.

#### Johnny Lawn and Ignacio Pascal
Johnny too envied Makoto's finances and wanted to frame him. After falling into poverty, he grew embarrassed and pitiful for having to ask Makoto for financial aid, even as a police officer. He wanted to frame Makoto for being a drug abuser, arrest him, then let him go, just to feel power over him again. He had never planned to kill him, but went about it in an extremely dangerous way. Ignacio's feelings were far stronger than Johnny's, as Makoto failed to save his son after a stroke. He hated Makoto for this, as he was supposed to be the "master neurosurgeon". 

Ignacio teamed up with Johnny (after careful consideration) and planned for Johnny to inject Makoto with heroin after stopping him for speeding. Afterwards, Ignacio would stop him again and inject him again. He antagonised Makoto, forcing him to erupt in rage and exit his car, mad about getting poked so often and about how he knew he wasn't speeding. Ignacio made sure the dosage of heroin in his syringe was lethal, and threw a small bag of heroin powder in the back of his car for good measure.

Ignacio entrusted Johnny with retrieving the syringes of heroin, as he didn't want to implicate himself if he got caught. Johnny managed to get three syringes of saline to swap out for heroin, but forgot which of the three syringes he put heroin into after filling the first syringe. When filling the second syringe with heroin, he accidentally poured out the first syringe again. After losing one in the changing room, he rushed to get the other two to Ignacio, ignoring the potential lacklustre potency as he didn't actually want to kill Makoto, only ruin his life. The syringes Makoto was injected with contained saline.

#### Adora Ada
Adora had long since fallen out of love for her husband. After he made it clear he didn't want to have any children with Adora, she began making plans to leave him. She then theorised that it was unlikely she would get any of his fortune if she initiated the divorce herself, as Makoto would have no reason to want to divorce her and might have simply kept his wealth to himself. However, he have a will written. The will dictated that Adora would inherit the entire estate after his death. 

Adora crafted an improvised explosive utilising knowledge of her chemistry classes, as well as looking up past examples in the library. She set it off behind the house on September 7th then left for a few days, claiming it to be a "business trip". She made a second bomb and placed it in front of the house.

Neither bomb went off. She set both incorrectly, and the second bomb (in front of the house) exploded the day after she returned, breaking a window and burning some grass. Because it was raining, no fires were started.

#### Jordan Cuno and Farah Sal-Cuno
Jordan and Farah were always an odd pair. Jordan, as the neglected child of the mayor, was always looking for a new way to piss him off. Their wife, Farah, supported their decisions but didn't always like them. Unlike the others, the pair did not intend to kill Makoto. At least, not initially.

Jordan's latest scheme was to steal a dog, get it hopped up on a variety of drugs, and let it run wild in the mayor's office. After witnessing Makoto leave the office in a bad mood, they had the idea to frame Makoto for the damages. Farah kidnapped her cousin's German Shepard and helped drug it, then set it on Makoto in the evening. They broke open his door and set the dog loose.

Makoto was already feeling extremely paranoid by that point, given everything that had happened to him that day. When he first heard his front door being picked open, he armed himself with two of the knives he had bought that day. The dog leapt on him, but it was so sick with everything the two gave it that it couldn't put up much of a fight. Makoto defended himself regardless, cutting the dog in its face, legs, and body. Jordan and Farah came in wearing black ski-masks, but Makoto was utterly terrified by this point. His heart gave out, and he collapsed on his couch having a heart attack. The couple ran out of the house, putting the now dead dog in a plastic bag and tossed it in the boot. They drove away as fast as they could but accidentally crashed the car in their panic. Jordan put both their bloody clothes into the bag and threw it into a river before visiting a hospital three cities away.

## Outside Events
### Death of Simon O'Hare
After Cuno and Bornstein's murder attempt, they threw away both pens, believing them to no longer contain the poison but wanting to destroy any evidence regardless. A 12-year-old boy, Simon, liked to collect pens he saw outside and drink their ink. Since both pens had their poison drain down into the ink, Simon ended up getting poisoned by the ink. He complained to his parents about stomach pains, but they assumed it was the food they ate that afternoon. Later in the day, Simon went out again and found the other pen and drank the ink from it. He then proceeded to die.

The poison was detected in Simon's blood and was checked for in Makoto's, but it was not found. 

### Heroin syringe
A syringe of heroin was found in a men's changing room. In spite of the numerous pricks found in Makoto's skin, most likely from a syringe, there was no trace of heroin found in his system.

### Improvised explosive
An improvised explosive was found behind Makoto's house. 

### Missing dog
The German Shepard of Farah's cousin, Chaz, had gone missing on September 7th. He has not been found since.

### Cut-out letter
A cut-out letter was delivered to Makoto's household at some point on September 8th. It was discovered during Marceline Ren's search of the house on September 12th. It reads:
"WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. LEAVE €10,000 IN CASH UNDERNEATH THE OLD BARN BY 11 P.M. OR WE WILL LEAK THE FOOTAGE"

## Sequence of Discovery
1. The first scene shows Marceline Ren talking to her future self, saying that she solves the case and needs to figure it out all today. She can't tell her the answer because of causality stuff, but it is vital that she ascertain what happened and who really killed Makoto Bourdain.
2. Marceline Ren meets with some police officers on behalf of the Patchwork Collective to investigate the matter. They have the days September 11 and 12 decompiled, so she can travel back to those two. The Hub is located in the mayor's office, so she has to travel to the mayor's building whenever she wants to travel through time.
3. She listens to a recording of Ignacio Pascal's last words, which tells her about Johnny's role in the event.
4. She interrogates Johnny, who confesses to the murder attempt. When informed that it was by heroin overdose, he assumes Ren already knows it was by the lost syringe found in the men's changing room and tells her about the syringes and poking. When she questions this, he realises his mistake and refuses to talk.
5. Ren considers the clues in her inventory, those being the death of Simon O'Hare, the missing dog, the explosive, and the syringe, which she now knows was what killed Ignacio.
6. The Patchwork Collective have decompiled days September 7 and 10 and the Player now has the option to travel back in time to these dates and speak to people about what happened.
7. She decides to pursue the "poking" and questions where else he went that day. Since he was wearing bandages when he died, Ren decides to question any cashiers in the area.
8. She speaks to Marie Bornstein and politely asks if she remembers Makoto buying any bandages from her. Marie is very shifty, telling them they don't have any more pens and asks if his death was by poison. Ren did not mention poison to her before this and asks her to clarify.
9. Marie begins freaking out and asks her to leave the store due to her being busy. 
10. Ren starts to question why Marie was acting to shifty and travels back in time to September 7th.
11. She runs into a man named [[#Chaz Sal]] who asks if she's seen her dog. She informs him she hasn't and makes her way to the market, where she runs into [[#Adora Aga]]. Ren recognises her and acts like an old friend, and Adora tells her that she's travelling to London for a business trip. She espouses how much she'd be able to relax and claims to be "ready to live freely real soon".
12. Ren finds that Marie isn't working on September 7th and leaves, only to find a young boy poking around the bushes outside the mayor's building. A woman is speaking to him. Ren asks if they're okay, and the woman claims to be his mother. The boy likes finding and eating things he sees on the ground, and he likes the mayor's building especially. Ren says goodnight to them and leaves.
13. Returning to September 12th, decides to question [[#Patrick Cuno]] next. He tells her he's busy and tries to leave, but she threatens to release the pictures of him and Marie to the public if he doesn't sit down with her. With that, he hesitantly obliges.
14. Ren asks about his relationship with Makoto and how he felt with him about to win the election. Patrick goes on a rant about how Makoto wasn't even qualified and honestly, it's actually for the best that he died since Shune needed a real politician to be mayor anyway. Ren reminds him that Makoto saved his child's life, but he dismisses it as anyone with any level of competency in that profession could do the same.
15. Ren asks to keep a pen as she collects them, but Patrick becomes irate, yelling that they have no more pens (in spite of the box on the counter). He tells her that if she wants to investigate something, he should look into Makoto's wife Adora going into that weird shack on the outside of town. She leaves, noting that Marie had was acting similarly. 
16. Returning to the Hub, she is informed that the missing dog has been found dead. When asking why that's so important, she's told the dog belonged to Chaz Sal, cousin of [[#Farah Sal-Cuno]], and that dog blood was found on Makoto's corpse. She is also told that they now have a search warrant for Adora's house and that September 9th has been decompiled.
17. From here, there are different options the Player can take. All paths lead to the Player returning to Patrick Cuno's office.
	1. Visiting Jordan Cuno and Farah Sal-Cuno
		1. Ren visits Farah's house, only to find her and her wife, [[#Jordan Cuno]] returning. Both have scars bandages around their arms and head and they ask what Ren is doing there. Ren asks them about Chaz's dog and Farah gets worried, but Jordan is calmer. They tell Ren that the dog is probably dead given how violent some of the kids can get. Ren asks them about their injuries and they tell her they got into a car accident a few days ago late at night and stayed out of town while they rested. 
		2. Ren asks Jordan about their father (Jordan informs them that they are agender) and Jordan directs them to their father's office if they need anything. Ren asks where their car is and how they got home, but Jordan cuts her off and goes inside with their wife.
	2. Visiting the Marie Bornstein at the market
		1. Ren's fellow investigator, [[#Mata Harris]], tells Ren that Marie attempted to flee the market when he questioned her and that she's at the police station for battery with a weapon (a bag of oranges). They also tell her that a broken pen was found on the ground, containing trace amounts of the same type of poison thought to kill [[#Simon O'Hare]]. Ren then realises that the young boy she saw at the mayor's building on Sep 7 must have been Simon O'Hare, and that the poison was likely there too. 
		2. Ren goes to the police station and asks Marie why she ran, and Marie confesses to killing Makoto. Ren expresses shock at the confession, until Marie says she injected him with a poison-tipped pen at the store and that she was tired and scared of lying anymore. Ren lets her speak, noting that Marie didn't actually kill Makoto, though she seems to think so. Her reasoning is odd and she implicates Patrick Cuno in her confession. Ren thanks her and asks the officers to look after, and heads to Patrick's office.
	3. Investigating Adora Aga's house
		1. Ren presents the search warrant to Adora's house and goes inside, with Mata Harris standing outside. Adora says she hasn't been anywhere that day, wanting to rest after returning from her trip the previous day. She finds discarded wires and watch parts hidden behind the fridge.
		2. Ren finds [[#Cut-out letter|a cut-out letter]] underneath some letters on the living room table. Patrick previously mentioned that Adora went to the shack that day and she asks Adora about the letter. She denies knowing about it and as the two argue about if Adora, Ren, or Patrick is lying, an explosion is heard and the front window shatters.
		3. Ren goes outside and finds a small patch of black grass underneath the front windows. The officer there has already called for backup to find any more bombs. Adora is fearful and tries to warn everyone about something she refuses to elaborate on, and one of the police officers calls out that they found another bomb.
18. If the Player did not go to the market, they get a call from Mata telling them that security reels were found in the dumpster, showing Marie's argument with Makoto.
19. Ren goes to question Patrick again but he apparently ran away. In the crowd outside the building, someone bumps into Ren and gives her a letter, telling her to meet them behind the mayor's building. Ren goes there and finds Farah, who confesses to murdering Makoto and her cousin's dog. 
20. Ren gently asks if Jordan helped her, and she hesitates before denying the accusation, but asks if implicating them would mean they both get a lighter sentence. Ren placates her and asks how she and Jordan killed Makoto, and she says they drugged the dog and set it loose in Makoto's house to stop it from attacking them. They saw him acting strange and erratic, and he kept clutching at his chest. When they went in to retrieve the dog, they saw Makoto on his couch covered in blood, and they both ran out.
21. At this point, Ren has received confessions from Farah + Jordan, Johnny + Ignacio, and Marie + Patrick, for which the second person never confessed themselves. Adora is clearly guilty of something. 
22. At this point, there are no more story points to find if the Player gets everything, and they can return to the Hub. If, instead of talking to the Overseer, the Player talks to Mata, they find out that September 8th has been decompiled and move to that day.
23. The events of September 8th play out as Ren stands by like a ghost. 

# Characters
## Major
### Makoto Bourdain
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Japanese/French (mixed)
**Hair**: Brown
**D.O.B.**: 1950/05/31 (deceased)
**Pronouns**: He/him
**Description**: Makoto was a very public figure. He was known by many people in the town, and as the resident neurosurgeon, he was one of the richest in the area. His hands saved several lives, including that of the mayor's child, [[#Jordan Cuno]]. On one occasion, he was voted to become the next mayor, but he graciously turned the offer down, notably saying that "\[he\] wouldn't want to upstage the old guys". The mayor, [[#Patrick Cuno]], took it in stride, but was reported to be "filled with divine rage" over the slight. 

Makoto was married to [[#Adora Aga]]. Their relationship was reportedly souring, with divorce being a genuine possibility. They were happy initially, having first met in France and marrying just two years later, but as the possibility of children quickly faded away, tensions rose between the couple.

He was known to be "aloof yet friendly". He would sometimes volunteer in the local soup kitchens, join and donate to charity events, and help out the elderly wherever he could. Among the children on Shune, he was called "The Cool Doctor".

Makoto had recorded paranoia and anxiety disorders, though this never appeared to cause much trouble in his life. He was not medicated despite his doctor's recommendation. He was one of four surgeons living in Shune, two being retired and the other a new graduate. His loss was greatly mourned in the community.

---
### Patrick Cuno
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Irish (White)
**Hair**: Blond
**D.O.B.**: 1926/04/29
**Pronouns**: He/him
**Description**: Patrick Cuno is the mayor of Shune, a small town on the outskirts of a city. He was voted into power nearly a decade ago, and everyone regrets their decision. Cuno's awful ruling has caused poverty, destruction, and corruption to plague the town, and yet he keeps getting voted into power by people who fear change. 

A joke entry by an unknown person resulted in Makoto Bourdain being entered into the upcoming election, and he received 48% of all votes without campaigning. He reportedly didn't even know he was running. Cuno took a very bold stance on the matter, pulling out show after show to get the public back on his side. However, nothing he did was working, and he seemed set to lose to Makoto in the next election until his sudden death. The results showed Makoto was leading at 64% to Cuno's 33%. The date of the election was September 10th.

It should be noted that Cuno's then-wife, Alice, divorced him on September 22nd. Rumours of his affairs seemed to spread everywhere, but the most prevalent of them all was a picture taken of what looked like Cuno and Marie Bornstein, a cashier, walking out of a hotel together. I'd say that's pretty damning evidence.

### Johnny Lawn
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Irish (White)
**Hair**: Blond
**D.O.B.**: 1934/03/11
**Pronouns**: He/him
**Description**: Johnny Lawn (really stupid name) was a close friend of Makoto. Makoto was frequently bullied due to his skinny stature. Johnny, whose father was a police officer, took it upon himself to protect him, though he still sometimes asked for bits of Makoto's lunch in return. The two grew up in a small community, going to the same primary and secondary schools.

After Makoto went abroad for his doctorate, Johnny began to miss the feelings of power he got. He thought becoming a police officer would satisfy that itch, and it did to an extent, but actual power, *real power* had left his grasp along with Makoto. Upon his arrival, his expertise was widely sought after and he made a tremendous amount of money. Johnny saw this as Makoto upstaging him, and his resentment only grew. 

His actions were pitiful and weak, following Pascal like a dog. Even if he does give up his badge, I doubt he'd ever be able to change.

### Ignacio Pascal
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Spanish (Latino)
**Hair**: White
**D.O.B.**: 1922/11/29
**Pronouns**: He/him
**Description**: Ignacio Pascal is the epitome of corruption. He was the police chief of Shune, and yet his heart was dirty to the core. He accepted bribes from criminals and local politicians alike to look the other way. He was abusive in his arrests, often causing bodily harm to those he detained. The entire department was like him and not one of them offered to provide insight on him until his death.

He was known to stage arrests by planting drugs or weapons in his victims' cars and arresting them on that offence. The police office rewarded officers for number of arrests, so this was an easy way for Pascal to make more money. Even if the arrests were later found out to be mistakes, the office wouldn't suffer large repercussions because almost no one in the town had enough money to pay for all the legal fees.

His deathbed confession outed Johnny Lawn (stupid name) as having a part in his death, which we now know was due to a heroin overdose. If he was alive, I'd interrogate the bastard until he cried.

### Adora Aga
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Ethiopian (Black)
**Hair**: Black
**D.O.B.**: 1952/08/08
**Pronouns**: She/her
**Description**: The wife of the deceased Makoto Bourdain. They met while Makoto returned to his father's village in France to get his doctorate there and promptly began dating. They married a few years later and returned from France with plans to have children. Makoto's job prospects were massive, so Adora had no need to find a job and prepared to become a stay at home mom. 

However, Makoto ended up changing his mind about having children, seemingly on a whim. Adora resented him for this but stayed by his side regardless, just in case he changed his mind. She had called several lawyers to initiate divorce proceedings, but stopped short every time. The last time she called a divorce lawyer was on September 2nd, six days before Makoto's death.

Her insistence on finding and reading Makoto's will is troubling, especially for a newly-widowed wife under unknown circumstances. I'd recommend searching the house as soon as the search warrant is granted, just in case.

### Jordan Cuno
**Skin/Ethnicity**: African/Irish (mixed)
**Hair**: Brown
**D.O.B.**: 1963/01/05
**Pronouns**: They/them
**Description**: The non-binary child of [[#Patrick Cuno]]. They are extremely impulsive, erratic, sudden, and any other descriptor you could use to describe someone with no thoughts in their head. Their relationship with their father, the mayor of Shune, seems to weigh on them quite a bit. They have a law degree, but don't appear to be using it for much, instead relying on allowances from Cuno.

Their wife, Farah, seems to be the thinker in their relationship. If Jordan sets out to do something, it's Farah who actually considers their options. Their accepting Farah's proposal probably had something to do with that.

Sometimes, they can be extremely cold and calculating. I would say "distant", but I wouldn't want to passively accuse them of having bipolar disorder. When they're in that mood, however, they can talk circles around even the smartest people I know.

The whole "not a man or woman" thing is interesting, but I don't judge. I wasn't always a woman, either.

### Farah Sal-Cuno
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Indian (Brown)
**Hair**: Brown
**D.O.B.**: 1961/15/12
**Pronouns**: She/her
**Description**: The wife of [[#Jordan Cuno]]. She proposed to Jordan at just 24, and Jordan surprisingly said yes. They seem to be one of the happiest couples in Shune, though given the general state of the town, that's not saying much. She recently completed her literature degree and writes for the local newspaper.

Her partner, who prefers to referred to as Farah's wife, tends to string her along into their more impulsive acts. Jordan's erratic and often dangerous behaviour actually isn't the worst of what they can do; Farah holds them back at every turn. This appears to cause her significant distress, which is understandable. If Farah is ever implicated in a crime, you can be sure Jordan isn't too far away.

Young love is strange. I can't relate to it, even as a 26-year-old woman, but I'd be seriously reconsidering why I would willingly marry such a character.

### Marie Bornstein
**Skin/Ethnicity**: German (Jewish)
**Hair**: Black
**D.O.B.**: 1947/19/06
**Pronouns**: She/her
**Description**: The burnt-out overachiever working as a cashier. She was born here in Shune and has never left the county, let alone the country. She was a gifted child, making straight-As in most of her classes in secondary school, but after failing her third year of college and the repeat, she simply stopped trying. She settled down and became a cashier at the local market, and remained a cashier ever since.

Marie has always been a vocal protestor of the poor and unhoused, seemingly uncaring whether or not they actually receive help but wanting them to leave Shune regardless. In spite of this, she is also a vocal supporter of Patrick Cuno, the mayor responsible for the town's poor conditions. She is one of five cashiers that work at the market, meaning she is often stressed and overworked.

Reports of her alleged affair with Patrick Cuno seem to hold true given the photo evidence. I wouldn't put it past her, given how lonely she seems.

## Minor
### Chaz Sal
**Skin/Ethnicity**: German (Jewish)
**Hair**: Black
**D.O.B.**: 1953/10/02
**Pronouns**: She/her
**Description**: Cousin of [[#Farah Sal-Cuno]]. It was his dog that was stolen.

### Simon O'Hare
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Slavic (Polish)
**Hair**: Brown
**D.O.B.**: 1977/07/07 (deceased)
**Pronouns**: He/him
**Description**: A 12-year old that enjoyed putting things he found on the ground in his mouth. He died after consuming the ink of a pen with poison in it.

### Mata Harris
**Skin/Ethnicity**: Nigerian (Black)
**Hair**: Black
**D.O.B.**: 1961/19/06
**Pronouns**: She/they
**Description**: One of Marceline's fellow investigators. Employed with the Patchwork Collective.
