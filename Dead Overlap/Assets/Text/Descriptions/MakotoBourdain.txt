[b]Description[/b]: Makoto was a very public figure. He was known by many people in the town, and as the resident neurosurgeon, he was one of the richest in the area. His hands saved several lives, including that of the mayor's child, Jordan Cuno. On one occasion, he was voted to become the next mayor, but he graciously turned the offer down, notably saying that "[he] wouldn't want to upstage the old guys". The mayor, Patrick Cuno, took it in stride, but was reported to be "filled with divine rage" over the slight. 

Makoto was married to Adora Aga. Their relationship was reportedly souring, with divorce being a genuine possibility. They were happy initially, having first met in France and marrying just two years later, but as the possibility of children quickly faded away, tensions rose between the couple.

He was known to be "aloof yet friendly". He would sometimes volunteer in the local soup kitchens, join and donate to charity events, and help out the elderly wherever he could. Among the children on Shune, he was called "The Cool Doctor".

Makoto had recorded paranoia and anxiety disorders, though this never appeared to cause much trouble in his life. He was not medicated despite his doctor's recommendation. He was one of four surgeons living in Shune, two being retired and the other a new graduate. His loss was greatly mourned in the community.
