[b]Description[/b]: The burnt-out overachiever working as a cashier. She was born here in Shune and has never left the county, let alone the country. She was a gifted child, making straight-As in most of her classes in secondary school, but after failing her third year of college and the repeat, she simply stopped trying. She settled down and became a cashier at the local market, and remained a cashier ever since.

Marie has always been a vocal protestor of the poor and unhoused, seemingly uncaring whether or not they actually receive help but wanting them to leave Shune regardless. In spite of this, she is also a vocal supporter of Patrick Cuno, the mayor responsible for the town's poor conditions. She is one of five cashiers that work at the market, meaning she is often stressed and overworked.

Reports of her alleged affair with Patrick Cuno seem to hold true given the photo evidence. I wouldn't put it past her, given how lonely she seems.
