[b]Description[/b]: The wife of the deceased Makoto Bourdain. They met while Makoto returned to his father's village in France to get his doctorate there and promptly began dating. They married a few years later and returned from France with plans to have children. Makoto's job prospects were massive, so Adora had no need to find a job and prepared to become a stay at home mom. However, Makoto ended up changing his mind about having children, seemingly on a whim. Adora resented him for this but stayed by his side regardless, just in case he changed his mind.

She had called several lawyers to initiate divorce proceedings, but stopped short every time. The last time she called a divorce lawyer was on September 2nd, six days before Makoto's death.
