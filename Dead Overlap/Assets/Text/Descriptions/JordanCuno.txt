[b]Description[/b]: The non-binary child of Patrick Cuno. They are extremely impulsive, erratic, sudden, and any other descriptor you could use to describe someone with no thoughts in their head. Their relationship with their father, the mayor of Shune, seems to weigh on them quite a bit. They have a law degree, but don't appear to be using it for much, instead relying on allowances from Cuno.

Their wife, Farah, seems to be the thinker in their relationship. If Jordan sets out to do something, it's Farah who actually considers their options. Their accepting Farah's proposal probably had something to do with that.

Sometimes, they can be extremely cold and calculating. I would say "distant", but I wouldn't want to passively accuse them of having bipolar disorder. When they're in that mood, however, they can talk circles around even the smartest people I know.

The whole "not a man or woman" thing is interesting, but I don't judge. I wasn't always a woman, either.
