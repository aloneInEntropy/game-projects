[b]Description[/b]: Johnny Lawn (really dumb name) was a close friend of Makoto. Makoto was frequently bullied due to his skinny stature. Johnny, whose father was a police officer, took it upon himself to protect him, though he still sometimes asked for bits of Makoto's lunch in return. The two grew up in a small community, going to the same primary and secondary schools.

After Makoto went abroad for his doctorate, Johnny began to miss the feelings of power he got. He thought becoming a police officer would satisfy that itch, and it did to an extent, but actual power, [i]real power[/i] had left his grasp along with Makoto. Upon his arrival, his expertise was widely sought after and he made a tremendous amount of money. Johnny saw this as Makoto upstaging him, and his resentment only grew.

His actions were pitiful and weak, following Pascal like a dog. Even if he does give up his badge, I doubt he'd ever be able to change.
