[b]Description[/b]: Ignacio Pascal is the epitome of corruption. He was the police chief of Shune, and yet his heart was dirty to the core. He accepted bribes from criminals and local politicians alike to look the other way. He was abusive in his arrests, often causing bodily harm to those he detained. The entire department was like him and not one of them offered to provide insight on him until his death.

He was known to stage arrests by planting drugs or weapons in his victims' cars and arresting them on that offence. The police office rewarded officers for number of arrests, so this was an easy way for Pascal to make more money. Even if the arrests were later found out to be mistakes, the office wouldn't suffer large repercussions because almost no one in the town had enough money to pay for all the legal fees.

His deathbed confession outed Johnny Lawn (stupid name) as having a part in his death, which we now know was due to a heroin overdose. If he was alive, I'd interrogate the bastard until he cried.
