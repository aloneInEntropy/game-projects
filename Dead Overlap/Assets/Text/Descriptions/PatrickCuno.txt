[b]Description[/b]: Patrick Cuno is the mayor of Shune, a small town on the outskirts of Dublin. He was voted into power nearly a decade ago, and everyone regrets their decision. Cuno's awful ruling has caused poverty, destruction, and corruption to plague the town, and yet he keeps getting voted into power by people who fear change. 

A joke entry by an unknown person resulted in Makoto Bourdain being entered into the upcoming election, and he received 48% of all votes without campaigning. He reportedly didn't even know he was running. Cuno took a very bold stance on the matter, pulling out show after show to get the public back on his side. However, nothing he did was working, and he seemed set to lose to Makoto in the next election until his sudden death. The results showed Makoto was leading at 64% to Cuno's 33%. The date of the election was September 10th.

It should be noted that Cuno's then-wife, Alice Cuno, divorced him on October 1st. Rumours of his affairs seemed to spread everywhere, but the most prevalent of them all was a picture taken of what looked like Cuno and Marie Bornstein, a cashier, walking out of a hotel together.
