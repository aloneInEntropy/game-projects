    Alright Farah, what did you want to tell me? What was up with that letter? ||f Modify Marceline | CompleteMission Speak to the writer of the note.

    I... I just couldn't keep it a secret anymore. I didn't want to get Jordan in trouble, you have to believe me! I just... I didn't know... I [i]never[/i] know what they're thinking! It's infuriating how they just never ask what [i]I[/i] want or what I think or... or... ||c Farah

    Hey, hey! It's alright! You guys aren't under arrest or anything - I don't even have that power, really. I'm just trying to figure out what happened to Makoto. Do you think you could help me? ||c Marceline

    We... we were just messing around, at first. Jordan found this bag of stuff -- I think it was heroin? -- and wanted to mess around with it. They obviously didn't mean injecting it into ourselves, but maybe into a small animal or something. Just to see what would happpen.
~7
    But a few days ago, Jordan bumped into Makoto at their father's office. Y'know, the mayor? He was angry about something and shoved them out of the way very rudely. They fell and sprained their ankle, but Makoto didn't even stop to say sorry. Probably because they were the kid of the guy he was mad at.
~8
    Jordan took it very personally. They decided we should find a slightly bigger animal and set it loose on Makoto's house to mess up the place. To be honest... I was angry too. They might be an asshole sometimes, but they're still my [b]fucking[/b] wife. No one shoves my wife like that and gets away with it. Not even him.
~9
    I stole my cousin Chaz's dog to use. Jordan asked that I didn't get an animal that might be noticed, but I forgot them saying that. It was only after they injected it with the heroin that they reminded me. That's solely my fault.
~10
    When we let it loose, we waited outside to take it back again. We never meant to kill him. Or at least I didn't.
~11
    We heard the dog hacking and coughing, and when we looked inside, Makoto was holding knives. I don't know where he got them from, but he was covered in blood. I ran in to grab the dog and get it out but Makoto looked at me, and he...
~12
    He had this... look... in his eyes. I don't know what it was, but I felt confident at the time that if I stayed there a moment longer, he was going to kill me. I ran out with the dog, threw it in the boot of our car in a bag, and we got the hell out of there. 
~~13
    That's it, really. Did you get all that?
