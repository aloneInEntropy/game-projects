	There are plenty of things to discover in Orast. Where would you like to begin?

				The farm.
				~#@0
					Well, the farm's just down the road to the east! I hear their milk is to die for.
			~@1
				The lake.
				~#@1
					Oh, that's fun! You can certainly relax yourself by the water there after your long travels! It's just to the west.
			~@2
				The market.
				~#@2
					Ah, I suppose you might be hungry after your journey! Or maybe just eager to make some money? Regardless, it's up here to the north.
			~@3
				Nowhere in particular.
				~#@3
					That's fair, I suppose. No need to rush yourself after arriving at our wonderful village!
			~@4
				That's all, thank you. |||

	Safe travels! Come back whenever you have any questions. I'm the mayor of this village, after all.

	Oh, one more thing. What's your favourite type of pie?
		~##4
			~@0
				Apple. ||f Test1 Apple 
				~#@0 
					Ah, wonderful. We have plenty of apple trees growing in the area. I'll make sure to pick a few for your welcoming party!
			~@1
				//Strawberry. ||j d2_1.txt p=1
				Strawberry.
				~#@1
					Ah, that's my favourite too! Maybe you could come with me to pick a few this afternoon? They're ripening soon.
			~@2
				I don't have a preference.
				~#@2
					A mystery, then! I wonder if that's a lack of preference or if you just don't like pie. Wow, someone who doesn't like pie. That's certainly a thought, huh?
			~@3
				Cinnamon.
				~#@3
					Ooh! Another cinnamon lover, huh? We don't have much of it at the moment, but there's a nice lady who lives a bit further in the woods near the farm who would love for you to have some. Why not visit her?
