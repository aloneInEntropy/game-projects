    Alright, this is video log... fifty-four, I think? We're having Christmas early so everyone can get their holidays in, and I'm one of those people, so I'll make this quick. I am Dr Lucy Alone and it is currently the 22nd of December, 2025.

    We just finished a prototype of the EMC, and it looks like it works alright. I managed to figure out the correlation between the Orten coordinate of localised conceptspace for an individual and the amount of information required to find it.

    Turns out it's near infinite, relatively speaking, but it's progress. I never really expected to locate a complete concept first try, y'know? Like, that's the point of the EMC to begin with.

    Did you get what I meant?
