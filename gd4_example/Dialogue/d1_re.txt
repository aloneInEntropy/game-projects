                Where is the farm?
                ~#@0
                    The farm's just down the road to the east. Travel slow enough, you won't miss it.

                Where is the lake?
                ~#@1
                    The lake is to the west. It will take a while though, so maybe stop by the market to get some refreshments first.

                Where is the market?
                ~#@2
                    The market is up here to the north. It's very close by, and as I said, you can buy and sell items there. Maybe bring back some flowers for me?

                No, nevermind.

                //     Well, then, go on your way! I'm not that interesting, I promise!

    On you go, then! I'll be seeing you!
