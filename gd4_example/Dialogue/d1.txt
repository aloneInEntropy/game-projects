					Well, the farm's just down the road to the east! I hear their milk is to die for.

				The lake. ||f Test2 Lucy Thalia
				~#@1
					Oh, that's fun! You can certainly relax yourself by the water there after your long travels! It's just to the west.

				The market. ||f SayHello
				~#@2
					Ah, I suppose you might be hungry after your journey! Or maybe just eager to make some money? Regardless, it's up here to the north.

				Strawberry.
				~#@1
					Ah, that's my favourite too! Maybe you could come with me to pick a few this afternoon? They're ripening soon.
			~@2
				I don't have a preference.
			~@3
				Cinnamon.
				~#@3
					Ooh! Another cinnamon lover, huh? We don't have much of it at the moment, but there's a nice lady who lives a bit further in the woods near the farm who would love for you to have some. Why not visit her?
